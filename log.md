**Today's Progress**: Decided to drop learning Java and switched in concentrating on Javascript. Started [the Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com/) and watched Mosh Hamedani's Javascript course

**Thoughts:** I finished the first project from The Odin Project which is purely HTML & CSS where I made a replica of Google homepage.
